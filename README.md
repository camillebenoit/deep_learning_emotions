# deep_learning_emotions
A project I did in python with a mate for a course at ITMO University.

The goal was to be able to recognize emotions between six basics emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust, anger) from images thanks to neural network with python.

To do so, we used landmarks facial attributes as inputs.

We did this project with google collab as our files are too heavy for github.
