# deep_learning_emotions
A project I did with a mate for a course at ITMO University.

The goal was to be able to recognize emotions between six basics emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust, anger) from images thanks to neural network.

To do so, we used landmarks facial attributes as inputs.

We did this project with google collab as our files are to heavy for github.
